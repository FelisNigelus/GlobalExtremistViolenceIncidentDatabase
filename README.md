# Worst Global Extremist Violence Incident Database
## From 1974 to 2019 (present day)
### Latest update 4th of May, 2019 NZST
 
While gathering data about global extremist violence incidents with the intention of analysing the Christchurch Mosques Massacre within a global context, we realised that such data was not readily accessible. It existed but it was spread across several websites and recorded on HTML tables. There was no one-whole set, put together in a standardised manner, in an accessible format (CSV, XLS, or other such), that anyone wishing to do an analysis could download and work with. So we set up to compile it.

We have gathered information from the 200 worst incidents of extremist violence from all over the world, going back as far as 1974.  As of 4th of May 2019 the dataset contains two hundred (200) incidents. 

For the purpose of the inclusion of an extremist violence incident in this dataset “worst” means the one of following two definitions: 
 - the number of direct victims (fatalities plus non-fatally injured) as a proportion of the population of the country in the year of occurrence is 1:1’000,000 or worse;
 - incidents with fewer proportional victims then 1:1’000,000 but of such infamy that they must be counted amongst the worst; for example, the 2011 Monterrey casino attack (México), the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings (India), the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting (USA), the July 2015 Kukawa massacre (Nigeria), or the Nishtar Park bombing (Pakistan).

We will incorporate into the dataset incidents that meet the “worst” criteria as they occur or as we find out about them.

## Contents

The dataset contains the “name” of the incident, the main country affected, the date(s) when it occurred, the population of the country in the year the incident occurred, the number of fatalities, the number of non-fatally injured, and the number of direct victims (fatalities plus non-fatally injured).

Using this data we have calculated a comparison statistic: how many people were unscathed for every victim.  We have calculated the statistic by number of fatalities, by number of non-fatally injured, and by number of direct victims (fatalities plus non-fatally injured).  The data used is that of the number of victims and the population of the country in the year the incident occurred.

For example, in the case of the Christchurch Mosques Massacre, the statistics are: 
 - 1 fatality for every 96,595 New Zealanders unscathed;
 - 1 non-fatally injured for every 100,538 New Zealanders unscathed;
 - 1 direct victim for every 49,263 New Zealanders unscathed.
 
Each incident has its own set of statistics as a function of their number of victims (fatalities, non-fatally injured, direct victims) and population.

## Methodology

 - The details for each incident are as recorded on the Wikipedia "List-of" articles referenced on the Sources list, except when having been corrected using information obtained from the incident's own Wikipedia article. 
 - The dates have been obtained from each incident's own Wikipedia article. 
 - When an incident does not indicate a number of non-fatally injured victims, that information is unknown and the field has been left blanc. 
 - When the number of victims has been uncertain and the victims have been stated as a range (between A and B) the high-end of the range of victims has been the one recorded.
 - When an incident has happened overnight starting on a date and finishing the following morning, it has been reflected as such on the dates (for example, the 2014 Gamboru Ngala attack).
 - Due consideration has been taken to any likely bias or agenda when gathering information from sources.  Sources have been cross-referenced to reduce bias risk.
