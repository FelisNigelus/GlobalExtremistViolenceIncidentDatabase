While gathering data about global extremist violence incidents with the intention of analysing the Christchurch Mosques Massacre within a global context, we realised that such data was not readily accessible. It existed but it was spread across many websites and recorded on HTML documents and tables. There was no one-whole set, put together in a standardised manner, in an accessible format (CSV, XLS, or other such), that anyone wishing to do an analysis could download and work with. So we set up to compile it.

Initially we identified  two hundred (200) worst incidents of extremist violence, from all over the world, since 1974.

For the purpose of the inclusion of an extremist violence incident in this dataset “*worst*” means the one of following two definitions:
 - the number of direct victims (fatalities plus non-fatally injured) as a proportion of the population of the country in the year of occurrence is 1:1’000,000 or worse;
 - incidents with fewer proportional victims than 1:1’000,000 but of such infamy that they should be counted amongst the worst; for example, the 2011 Monterrey casino attack (México), the 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings (India), the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting (USA), the July 2015 Kukawa massacre (Nigeria), or the Nishtar Park bombing (Pakistan).

We will incorporate into the dataset incidents that meet the “worst” criteria as they occur or as we find out about them.

## Contents

The dataset contains the “name” of the incident, the main country affected, the date(s) when it occurred, the population of the country in the year the incident occurred, the number of fatalities, the number of non-fatally injured, and the number of direct victims (fatalities plus non-fatally injured).

Using this data we have calculated a comparison statistic: how many people were unscathed for every victim.  We have calculated the statistic by number of fatalities, by number of non-fatally injured, and by number of direct victims (fatalities plus non-fatally injured).  The data used is that of the number of victims and the population of the country in the year the incident occurred.

For example, in the case of the Christchurch Mosques Massacre, the statistics are:
 - 1 fatality for every 96,595 New Zealanders unscathed;
 - 1 non-fatally injured for every 100,538 New Zealanders unscathed;
 - 1 direct victim for every 49,263 New Zealanders unscathed.

Each incident has its own set of statistics as a function of its number of victims (fatalities, non-fatally injured, direct victims) and the population of the country.

## Methodology

 - The details for each incident are as recorded on the Wikipedia "List-of" articles referenced on the Sources list, except when having been corrected using information obtained from the incident's own Wikipedia article.
 - The dates have been obtained from each incident's own Wikipedia article.
 - When an incident does not indicate a number of non-fatally injured victims, that information is unknown and the field has been left blanc.
 - When the number of victims has been uncertain and the victims have been stated as a range (between A and B) the high-end of the range of victims has been the one recorded.
 - The perpetrators are not included in any of the counts.
 - When an incident has happened overnight starting on a date and finishing the following morning, it has been reflected as such on the dates (for example, the 2014 Gamboru Ngala attack).
 - Due consideration has been taken to any likely bias or agenda when gathering information from sources.  Sources have been cross-referenced to reduce bias risk.
 - In all cases of conflicting information, multiple cross-referenced sources have been used.
 - Moving forward, we will be systematically examining compilations of extremist violence incidents in order to identify those that we may have not identified yet.
 - As this database is meant to be an aide for examination and analysis, rather than an exhaustive compilation of every extremist violence incident in history, we have made the design decision to only include incidents from 1973 onwards.

## The Database

[Worst Global Extremist Violence Incident Database](https://github.com/FelisNigelus/GlobalExtremistViolenceIncidentDatabase/blob/master/WGEVID.xls "Version 1.01 Latest update 05/05/2019 215 records")

 - Each time the file WGEVID.xls is changed a SHA1 hash is computed.
 - Each time the file WGEVID.xls is changed it is signed.

We are in the process of identifying other relevant compilations and lists.

Complemented by each incident's own Wikipedia article; referenced sources in the incident's Wikipedia articles; media of record such as Radio New Zealand, BBC News, Al Jazeera, Mother Jones, CNN, and others; media of record from the countries in which the incidents occurred; plus other authoritative sources, when journalistic sources are inconclusive or contradictory.

The population information was obtained from [PopulationPyramid.net](https://www.populationpyramid.net). When a region is not on PopulationPyramid, statistical information is used to obtain its population for the year required.
